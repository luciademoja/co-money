### Shared economy

Economy sharing happens everywhere, all the time. Maybe you are in a relationship, have a room mate or going on a holiday with your friends. Chances are that you or someone else will make a purchase for more than yourself. Comoney makes it super easy to automate these expenses by connecting the users bank accounts. In realtime you'll know who purchased something and for how much. Comoney is a tool to keep up on who spent the most money on shared purchases and possibly give an indication on who's picking up the next tab or paying for tonights cinema tickets. But first and foremost put an end to receipts and useless arguments!
